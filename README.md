# Customer Behaviour Analysis

This project aims to analyze customer behavior patterns using various data analysis techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization to derive insights into customer preferences and actions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized within a Jupyter Notebook, consisting of the following main components:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project's goals and objectives.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and summary statistics to understand the data's structure and key patterns.
4. **Modeling**: Application of machine learning models (if included) to predict or classify customer behavior.
5. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and potential next steps
